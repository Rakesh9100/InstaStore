## <p align="center">```InstaStore``` - Instagram Photo and Video Downloader</p>

InstaStore is a python coded script to download Photos &amp; Videos from Instagram without any API access.

I have made this project to make good use of social media like Instagram by downloading some useful images or some informative videos and do share to rest of their acquaintances.

This is a tool, where you can just copy and paste the link of Instagram Photos and Videos and it will get downloaded in your respective location with the help of Internet connection.<br>
And just write the Instagram username to download Profile Picture of that account.
